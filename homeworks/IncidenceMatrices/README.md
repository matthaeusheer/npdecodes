# Incidence matrices of a hybrid 2D mesh

This exercise introduces the concept of edge-vertex and cell-edge incidence matrices.
Furthermore you will work with LehrFEM++'s `lf::mesh::hybrid2d::Mesh` and the entities it contains.
You'll have to use basic functionalities of the data types `Mesh`, `Entity`, and derived types.

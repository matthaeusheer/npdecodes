### Generating the Plots of the Mastersolution

We assume that you have already generated the executables of this problem.
Then move with your terminal into the folder `./build/homeworks/DiscontinuousGalerkin1D` and run:

1.  `./DiscontinuousGalerkin1D_mastersolution`
2.  `python plot_mastersolution.py`

This should generate the file `solution.eps`, which contains the plot.

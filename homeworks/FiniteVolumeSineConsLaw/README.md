### Generating the Plots of the Mastersolution

We assume that you have already generated the executables of this problem.
Then move with your terminal into the folder `./build/homeworks/FiniteVolumeSineConsLaw` and run:

1.  `./1DWaveAbsorbingBC_mastersolution`
2.  `python plot_mastersolution.py ufinal.csv`
3.  `python plot_mastersolution.py ufinal_reaction.csv`

This should generate the files `ufinal.eps` and `ufinal_reaction.eps`, which contain the plots.

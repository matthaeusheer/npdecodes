### Generating the Plots of the Mastersolution

We assume that you have already generated the executables of this problem.
Then move with your terminal into the folder `./build/homeworks/1DWaveAbsorbingBC` and run:

1.  `./1DWaveAbsorbingBC_mastersolution`
2.  `python viswave_mastersolution.py`
3.  `python visenergies_mastersolution.py`

This should generate the files `viswave.png` and `visenergies.png`, which contain the plots.

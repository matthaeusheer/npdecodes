Linear Finite Element Reaction Diffusion

This problem should teach some lehrfempp utilities such as mesh refinement and lagrangian
finite elements. It solves the problem \int{\Omega} grad(u) grad(v) dx =  \int{\Omega} x_1 x_2 grad(v) dx
using linear lagrangian finite elements. Afterwards it computes the energy and prints the converging
energy evaluations as the mesh gets tighter.

### Generating the Plots of the Mastersolution

We assume that you have already generated the executables of this problem.
Then move with your terminal into the folder `./build/homeworks/LaxWendroffScheme` and run:

```
./LaxWendroffScheme_mastersolution
python plot_mastersolution.py
```

This should generate the file `convergence.eps`, which contains the plots.
